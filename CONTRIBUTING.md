## Conventions

To keep the code base concise, there are some base rules which are checked automatically.

### Commit Naming

This project uses [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) in combination with [conventional commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) to ensure an unified commit naming and potentially be able to do [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This means that commit messages should start with a type like "feat" or "fix". For more information, see the linked documentation.

### Formatting / Linting

To keep the code clean, prettier and eslint are in use. If necessary, you can adjust the rules in `.eslintrc` and `.pretierrc`. These tests are also run on staged files before committing.
